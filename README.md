# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using sentiment analysis techniques. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights from textual data.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Movie review text
- Sentiment labels (positive/negative)

## Methodology
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, removal of stopwords, and lemmatization.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Used TF-IDF and word embeddings.
3. **Model Training**: Trained classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and LSTM.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy and F1-score.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: nltk, sklearn, pandas, numpy, keras, matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the notebook file: `FUTUREINTERNS-ML-02-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-ON-MOVIES-REVIEW.ipynb`.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of X% and an F1-score of Y%.
